# MobileWM

1. Possible performance optimisations.<br>
   - Using navigation UI was a possibility. This will create one base Activity and multiple fragments.<br>
   - Network connectivity could have been done with Broadcast receiver.<br>
   - Constraint Layout was used in few places. If complex UI had to be brought up, this library could have been used widely.<br>
   
2. Which things could be done better, than youâ€™ve done it<br>

   - Location retrieval can be done with service as well. <br>
   - Application supports from API 16. But as device was not available with API 16, testing with device was not an option. Even though testing was done with Pie and Lollipop version. <br>
